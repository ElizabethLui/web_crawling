# Web Crawling Project

This project's aims are two fold. First, it cleans a messy, unstructured text file to find urls which link to an individual news article. Second, it loops over the list of urls (n=190) to extract useful information - i.e. title of news, publication date, as well as the tags used to classified the news.
